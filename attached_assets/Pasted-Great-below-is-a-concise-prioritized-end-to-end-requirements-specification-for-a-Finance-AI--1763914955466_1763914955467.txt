Great — below is a concise, prioritized, end-to-end **requirements specification** for a Finance AI project (production-ready), covering functional scope, data, ML approach, infra, security, metrics, UX, testing, and deliverables. Use this as your blueprint when designing, building, or scoping work. I also included the local reference file you uploaded for context: `/mnt/data/UX Assignment - 2026 ( updated )  (1).pdf`.

---

# 1) Project goal (one-liner)

Build a privacy-first Finance AI platform that analyzes user transactions, detects fraud, recommends tax and budgeting optimizations, scores financial health, and provides actionable investment and savings guidance — all with explainability and secure deployment.

---

# 2) Core features (high priority)

1. **Transaction ingestion & normalization**

   * Connectors: bank CSV/statement import, UPI/QR/UPI sandbox, credit card CSV, manual entry.
   * Normalize: merchant name cleaning, category inference, currency conversion, timestamps.

2. **Fraud detection (real-time & batch)**

   * Rule-based realtime checks + ML anomaly detector (behavioral + outlier detection).
   * Alerting and action (block, flag, require 2FA, notify user).

3. **Spending categorization & patterns**

   * Automated expense categorization (food, travel, bills, subscriptions).
   * Clustering of recurring payments and subscription detection.

4. **Financial Health Score**

   * Composite score (income stability, expense ratio, savings rate, debt ratio, liquidity).
   * Explainable breakdown with suggestions.

5. **Budget & Goal Planner**

   * Allow user goals (emergency fund, vacation, EMI payoff).
   * Automated monthly budget suggestions; track progress.

6. **Tax estimation & optimization**

   * Estimate tax liability for user (country-specific rules).
   * Suggest tax-saving instruments and projections (e.g., investments, deductions).

7. **Investment analyzer**

   * Portfolio overview (if linked manually).
   * Risk profile questionnaire → recommend asset allocation (basic).
   * Simulate simple returns and visualize scenarios.

8. **Privacy & Data Control**

   * Local PII masking, opt-in data sharing, export & delete features.
   * Differential privacy / anonymization for analytics (optional).

9. **APIs & Integrations**

   * REST API for front-end, webhook notifications, and a sandbox payment/mock API for testing (Razorpay-like).

10. **Admin & Monitoring**

    * Dashboard for fraud review, model drift alerts, data pipeline health.

---

# 3) Functional requirements (detailed)

* **User Accounts**

  * Signup/login (email + password, OAuth optional), multi-factor auth.
  * Role-based access (user, admin, compliance).

* **Data Import**

  * CSV uploader; parser for common bank formats.
  * Periodic syncing for connected accounts (if supported).

* **Transaction Processing Pipeline**

  * ETL steps: ingest → clean → classify → enrich (merchant enrichment, geo, MCC mapping).

* **ML Modules**

  * Categorization: multiclass classifier (supervised).
  * Fraud detection: unsupervised (isolation forest / autoencoder) + supervised classifier for labelled fraud.
  * Anomaly detection: time-series models (Prophet / LSTM / seasonal decompositions).
  * Clustering: monthly spend clusters (k-means / HDBSCAN).

* **User UX**

  * Dashboard with KPI strip: total spend, savings, health score, upcoming bills.
  * Drill-down transaction list with edit/correct category.
  * Goal set-up wizard and progress visual.
  * Inline suggestions with “Why this?” explainability.

* **Export & Reports**

  * Download CSV/PDF tax summary, monthly statements.

---

# 4) Data requirements

* **Transactions**: date, amount, currency, merchant, type, account id, raw description, location (optional).
* **User profile**: income, dependents, tax status, existing loans/investments (optional).
* **Labels**: category labels, fraudulent flags for supervised training.
* **External**: merchant name normalization lists, MCC codes, tax rules dataset, FX rates, CPI (for inflation adjustments).

Data volume estimate (starter): 10k–100k transactions for robust classic models; more for deep learning/time-series.

---

# 5) ML approach & models

* **Categorization**

  * Model: LightGBM / XGBoost on tokenized merchant + engineered features (amount patterns, frequency).
  * Fallback: rule-based mapping for exact merchants.

* **Fraud detection**

  * Real-time rules (amount > threshold, location mismatch).
  * Offline: IsolationForest / Autoencoder on sequence features for new-user anomaly detection.
  * Supervised classifier (if labeled fraud exists): XGBoost with class imbalance handling.

* **Spending patterns**

  * Time-series decomposition + clustering for recurring vs one-off detection.

* **Financial Health Score**

  * Weighted index combining normalized finance metrics; learned weights from typical cohorts or expert rules. Provide component breakdown.

* **Explainability**

  * SHAP values (or feature importance) for model outputs (fraud/categorization/score).

---

# 6) Evaluation metrics

* **Categorization**: accuracy, macro-F1, confusion matrix (focus on common categories).
* **Fraud detection**: precision@k, recall (catch rate), AUC-ROC, false positive rate (minimize for UX).
* **Anomaly detection**: precision of alerts (human-in-loop validation).
* **Business metrics**: time saved per user, increase in saved amount, reduction in fraudulent losses (tracked post-deploy).

---

# 7) API & endpoints (essential)

* `POST /ingest/transactions` — upload CSV or JSON.
* `GET /transactions?user={id}&from=&to=` — list with filters.
* `POST /transactions/correct` — edit category.
* `GET /dashboard/{user}` — aggregated KPIs.
* `POST /goals` — create goal.
* `GET /opportunity/matrix` — if providing candidate-like mapping (not required here).
* `POST /fraud/alert` — webhook for alerting.
* `GET /tax/estimate` — returns tax summary.
* `GET /health/score` — returns score + breakdown.

Auth: JWT bearer tokens.

---

# 8) UX & frontend requirements

* Responsive dashboard (desktop-first).
* Explainable callouts near every recommendation (“Because you spent X on Y last month”).
* Manual correction UX for categories with “teach model” option.
* Clear alerting UI for fraud with “mark false positive” flow.
* Goal visualizations (progress bars, projected completion dates).

---

# 9) Security, privacy & compliance

* **Encryption**: at-rest (AES-256) and in-transit (TLS 1.2+).
* **Auth**: JWT, OAuth optional, MFA for sensitive actions.
* **PII minimization**: store only needed fields; allow user data export & delete (GDPR right to be forgotten).
* **Logging/Access control**: audit trails for changes, admin actions.
* **Compliance**: local tax/regulatory requirements, PCI if handling payments; KYC for payment features.
* **Threat detection & rate limiting**.

---

# 10) Infrastructure & deployment

* **Cloud**: AWS/GCP/Azure.

* **Components**:

  * Ingest pipeline: serverless (AWS Lambda) or containerized workers (K8s).
  * Storage: PostgreSQL for metadata + S3 for raw files.
  * Feature store: Redis or Postgres materialized views.
  * Model serving: FastAPI/Gunicorn + Docker; or use SageMaker/Vertex AI.
  * Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana, Sentry for errors.
  * CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Docker builds, infra-as-code (Terraform).

* **Scaling**: batch pipelines for training; streaming or near-real-time for fraud detection.

---

# 11) Testing & QA

* **Unit tests** for ETL and model pipelines.
* **Integration tests** for connectors and endpoints.
* **E2E tests** for frontend flows (Cypress).
* **Model validation**: backtesting, holdout sets, cross-validation.
* **User acceptance testing** with a small pilot group.

---

# 12) Monitoring & operations (MLOps)

* Log model predictions and inputs (with PII masking).
* Track data drift, concept drift; trigger retraining when thresholds crossed.
* Model versioning (MLflow) and rollout strategies (canary).
* Alerting for pipeline failures and abnormal model behavior.

---

# 13) Roadmap & milestones (suggested)

**Phase 0 (2 weeks)**: Project setup, data exploration, wireframes, MVP scoping.
**Phase 1 (4–6 weeks)**: Build ingestion, baseline categorization model, dashboard UI MVP.
**Phase 2 (4 weeks)**: Fraud detection rules + basic ML model, quick actions, goal planner.
**Phase 3 (4 weeks)**: Tax estimator, investment analyzer MVP, explainability.
**Phase 4 (2–4 weeks)**: Harden security, testing, pilot & feedback, launch.
Total MVP timeline: ~12–16 weeks.

---

# 14) Deliverables (MVP)

* Data pipeline & ingestion module.
* Transaction categorization model + retrain pipeline.
* Real-time rule engine for fraud.
* Dashboard UI with KPI strip, transactions list, goals.
* Command/API docs + Postman collection.
* Rationale doc & model cards (metrics, data used).
* Pilot deployment and monitoring setup.

---

# 15) Risks & mitigation

* **Poor data quality** → invest early in merchant normalization & heuristics.
* **High false positives in fraud** → combine ML with human-in-loop review.
* **Regulatory complexity** → limit tax features to estimation + clear disclaimers; escalate legal review.
* **Privacy concerns** → default data minimization, explicit consent flows.

---

# 16) Example tech stack (recommended)

* Backend: Python (FastAPI)
* ML: scikit-learn, LightGBM, PyTorch/TensorFlow (if DL needed)
* Data: PostgreSQL, Airflow (or Prefect), S3
* Frontend: React + Tailwind/CSS; Charting: Recharts/Plotly
* Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), GitHub Actions
* Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry
* MLOps: MLflow or SageMaker

---

# 17) Final notes & next steps

1. **Define MVP scope** explicitly (which features go into MVP).
2. **Collect sample transaction data** (anonymized) and produce an initial data profile.
3. **Prototype UI flows** (dashboard, alerts, corrections) in Figma and validate with 3–5 users.
4. **Implement ingestion + categorization baseline** to quickly generate value.
5. **Pilot fraud rules** with small user base before model-based blocking.

If you want I can:

* produce a one-page MVP scope doc, or
* draft a 12-week sprint plan with tasks, or
* generate starter code scaffolding (FastAPI + sample pipelines), or
* build the Figma dashboard wireframe for the Finance AI dashboard.

Which of the above next?
